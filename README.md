# Landing-Page
This is the Landing page project, which is the second one, from the Odin Project.
It will allow me to practice the "html" and "css" skills learned so far.
To complete the page with images i downloaded some images from https://www.pexels.com/. I thank Tyler Lastovich, Ricardo Esquivel, Damon Hall and the Arthouse Studio for allowing me to use their beautiful sea pictures.
